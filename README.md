# Rose-Lab-Behavior-Data

## Sample_Excel_File:
This is an example Excel file that shows what Micaela originally (manually) did. Any files outputted here don't necessarily have to look like this, but it should give a good idea of what she did and how she did it.

## Sample_Results_Folder:
This is an example folder with a bunch of feat_manual.hdf5 files inside of it. This is what TierPsy's data output looks like (it creates folders that look like this), so this is what any raw data will look like.

## Sample_Video:
This is an example video that just shows what kinds of videos these data are coming from.

## Other:
**GitHub for TierPsy**: https://github.com/ver228/tierpsy-tracker

**JupyterLab (for fucking with .ipynb files)**: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

**Sample-Output-Graphs**: Sorry these don't have axis labels, lol. These are the original output graphs Micaela did, to give you an idea of the end goal.

**What-Micaela-Did**: Basically a README file Micaela made for me. Might not have everything needed since she made it pretty quick, so definitely talk to Micaela.
