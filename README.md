# Rose-Lab-Behavior-Data

## Sample_Excel_File:
This is an example Excel file that shows what Micaela originally (manually) did. Any files outputted here don't necessarily have to look like this, but it should give a good idea of what she did and how she did it.

## Sample_Results_Folder:
This is an example folder with a bunch of feat_manual.hdf5 files inside of it. This is what TierPsy's data output looks like (it creates folders that look like this), so this is what any raw data will look like.

## Sample_Video:
This is an example video that just shows what kinds of videos these data are coming from.
